GNURender (ALPHA) is an opensource renderfarm management software package designed exclusive to work with Blender. It is cross platform (Windows, Linux & Mac) and has a nice webbased administrator interface. Unlike other renderfarm software GNURender uses a MySQL database to store everything including the graphical data.

GNURender makes use of the latest techniques:

C# / .NET / Mono
PHP
MySQL
Bootstrap
JQuery
The render node is built with MONO and therefore runs on Windows, Linux & Macintosh.
